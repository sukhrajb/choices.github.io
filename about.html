<h1>About</h1>
<p>    When you open the first door it takes you to a separate tab, 
    then you go back to the first tab open the second door and it opens in the second tab that's already been open, 
    and this continues for each door. However, if the user chooses to click the back button in the second tab, 
    rather than going to the original tab, then the page refreshes and the order of the doors changes. With the first option,
     the user had a structured system of going in order of doors from one tab to another, and being able to view each door in order. 
     With the second option, the order of doors is arranged randomly, so there is the possibility of opening the same door twice or even thrice, 
     causing them to be in a chaotic loop of the same shows.</p>
