<h1>About</h1>
<p>This website consits of a hallway of doors; each door will lead you to a different show, this was created to help solve the problem of not knowing what to watch but yet to help keep the choice in your hands. 
    When you open the first door it takes you to a separate tab, then you go back to the first tab open the second door and it opens in the second tab that's already been open, and this continues for each door. However, if the user chooses to click the back button in the second tab, rather than going to the original tab, then the page refreshes and the order of the doors changes. With the first option, the user had a structured system of going in order of doors from one tab to another, and being able to view each door in order. With the second option, the order of doors is arranged randomly, so there is the possibility of opening the same door twice or even thrice, causing them to be in a chaotic loop of the same shows.

 <h2>Half of Streaming Subscribers Can’t Decide What to Watch, but Just One-Third Would Use a Feature That Picks a Program for Them
    More than half of adults who subscribe to five or more streaming platforms would use a shuffle feature
    </h2> 
    <p class="three">More than half of adults who subscribe to five or more streaming platforms would use a shuffle feature</p>  
    <p class="four">Half of the 1,362 streaming subscribers surveyed said they have a hard time deciding what to watch on streaming services.

        36% of streaming subscribers — including 56% of respondents who subscribe to five or more services — said they were likely to use a shuffle feature that randomly selected a film or TV show for them to watch.
        
        27% of streaming subscribers said there are too many entertainment options available on streaming services.
        
        It’s a common question in our modern times that’s gained new importance amid the pandemic: “What do you want to watch tonight?”
        
        With more than 200 streaming services on the market — each with its own content library — that question is becoming more difficult to answer. FX Networks’ most recent Peak TV report found that there were 532 U.S. scripted original dramas, comedies and limited series in 2019, up from 495 in 2018. 
        
        And as Netflix Inc. continues to test a shuffle feature that randomly selects content for viewers, polling finds that some streaming service subscribers are interested in technology that will help them simplify their decision making.</p>
