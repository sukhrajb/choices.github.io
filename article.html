<h1 class="title">Half of Streaming Subscribers Can’t Decide What to Watch, but Just One-Third Would Use a Feature That Picks a Program for Them

<p>It’s a common question in our modern times that’s gained new importance amid the pandemic: “What do you want to watch tonight?” 
     
    
<p>With more than 200 streaming services on the market — each with its own content library — that question is becoming more difficult to answer. FX Networks’ most recent Peak TV report found that there were 532 U.S. scripted original dramas, comedies and limited series in 2019, up from 495 in 2018.</p>
<p>And as Netflix Inc. continues to test a shuffle feature that randomly selects content for viewers, polling finds that some streaming service subscribers are interested in technology that will help them simplify their decision making.</p>

<p>A July 17-19 Morning Consult poll found that half of the 1,362 streaming service subscribers surveyed have a hard time deciding what to stream. And data from Reelgood, shared exclusively with Morning Consult, helps illustrate why: The roughly 140 streaming services available in the United States that Reelgood tracks, offer 76,366 movies and 16,177 TV shows for viewers to choose from. </p>

<p>That said, when it comes to the amount of content available on these services, subscribers are largely satisfied with their options: Fifty-eight percent said there are the right amount of entertainment options available to watch on streaming services, while 27 percent said there are too many. The share who are satisfied with the amount of options does not change based on how many streaming services a respondent subscribes to.</p>

<p>“I think it’s really important for the consumer to have a significant amount of choices,” said Brad Gastwirth, chief technology strategist with Wedbush Securities. “I agree that consumers are more frustrated now than ever with having more choices, but I also think that’s a better thing than having less.” </p>

<p>Steve Nason, director of research at Parks Associates, said with services offering so many films and TV shows, one of the largest challenges facing all OTT services is “content discovery and content recommendation.”</p>

<p>“The amount of content within a service and across services just makes it overwhelming,” he said. </p>
